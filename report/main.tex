\begin{abstract}
  Neural networks have shown great promise in the field of computer vision.
  These advances are recently being used to solve problems ranging from
  autonomous vehicles to online shopping. We present a method that uses an
  end-to-end neural network to control a TurtleBot robot through an arbitrary
  course. We compare the performance of two different neural network
  architectures to the performance of an end-to-end control method based on
  classical computer vision methods.
